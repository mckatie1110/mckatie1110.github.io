      <h2>Greenville Pediatric Dentistry Website</h2>
      <p>This is my first website project! After about seven weeks of learning each step to building a website, this is almost the final step! There are still some edits and additional pages I would like to add to this site later.</p>
      <p>This project was a website redesign. Each student was assigned a dentist website. Mine was <a>"www.greenvillepediatricdentistry.com"</a></p>

=======
      <p>One of my main focuses with this site redesign was to give the user a more enjoyable experience.  In order to provide this experience I changed the colors to a lighter, more neutral pallete that worked well together.  I also added icons and a new logo to give a better image to type ratio. The old site had a lot of verbage and it was easy for the user to get lost while trying to read all of the words.  Another big change that I made to this site was the addition of a "new patient" page and a way to schedule an appointment online. As I was researching, I noted that many other dentist websites have these features.  The addition of the "new patients" page and the ability to schedule an appointment online made this site look more up to date.</p>

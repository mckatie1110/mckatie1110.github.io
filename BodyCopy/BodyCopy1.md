	Name: Greenville Pediatric Dentistry Website
		Information: This is my first website project! After about seven weeks of learning each step to building a website, this is almost the final step! There are still some edits and additional pages I would like to add to this site later.
	This project was a website redesign. Each student was assigned a dentist website. Mine was www.greenvillepediatricdentistry.com
	Check out the original coded Style Tiles for this project here: [StyleGuides](http://mckatie1110.github.io/Styleguides/).		Link to GitHub: http://mckatie1110.github.io/Greenville-Pediatric-Dentistry/

	Name: Style Tiles for Dentistry Website
		Information: This is one of the steps in planning to design a website. Style Tiles are great for showing a client the color palette, typography, and imagery that will be used in the site. When you pair a style tile with a wire frame you can almost see what the final website might look like.

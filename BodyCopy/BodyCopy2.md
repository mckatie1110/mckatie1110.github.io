About Me
--------


Hi – I’m Katie McCarthy and I recently graduated from The Iron Yard in Greenville, South Carolina with training in website design,In my free time, when I’m not rollerblading, racing my Miata or reading a book in my eno, you might find me with my bunny, Bella. I also have a fairly large seashell collection, which you may have seen. I keep them scattered on beaches all over the world.Thank you for visiting my website and please call me if I can help your business.   Latest Project:
--------------	
	Name: Greenville Pediatric Dentistry Website
		Information: This is my first website project! After about seven weeks of learning each step to building a website, this is almost the final step! There are still some edits and additional pages I would like to add to this site later.
	This project was a website redesign. Each student was assigned a dentist website. Mine was www.greenvillepediatricdentistry.com
	Check out the original coded Style Tiles for this project here: [StyleGuides](http://mckatie1110.github.io/Styleguides/).		Link to GitHub: http://mckatie1110.github.io/Greenville-Pediatric-Dentistry/
	Past Project:
--------------
	Name: Style Tiles for Dentistry Website
		Information: This is one of the steps in planning to design a website. Style Tiles are great for showing a client the color palette, typography, and imagery that will be used in the site. When you pair a style tile with a wire frame you can almost see what the final website might look like.
